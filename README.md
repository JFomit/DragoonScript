# DragoonScript
This repository contains source code for various components of *DragoonScript* - a functional programming language.

This project was originally developed for a term paper of 2nd semester in BSUIR. Now, however, I use it as my personal playground in
programming language design and implementation.

# Component overview
`Spear` is a compiler for DragoonScript, written in C#. Its sources are located in `Spear` submodule.
